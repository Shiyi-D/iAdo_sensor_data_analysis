# Data analysis of iAdo2m sensor

Welcome to the data analysis of iAdo2m sensor! </p>

Here I have some tips to help you follow up ASAP: </p>
>'baseline_precise_0709.ipynb' is the newest edition where you can find the whole pipeline of what we need. </p>
>'baseline_precise_0114.ipynb' is the notebook in which you can generate and save 'phase' files(when you see: '../iAdo2m_phase.tiff', '../jRGECO1a_phase.tiff' in _0709). </p>
>'baseline_precise_0125.ipynb' is the notebook where you can generate and save 'velocity' files(when you see: '../temp_output/ix.npy', '../temp_output/iy.npy', '../temp_output/jx.npy', '../temp_output/jy.npy' in _0709). </p>
